# Test: Empty array with commented-out example items
# Purpose: Verify that "env: []" with trailing commented examples gets cleaned up
# Expected: After conversion, the commented examples should be removed

# Basic case - empty array with single commented item
env: []
  # - name: DATABASE_URL
  #   value: postgres://localhost/db

# Empty array with multiple commented items
volumes: []
  # - name: data
  #   emptyDir: {}
  # - name: config
  #   configMap:
  #     name: app-config

# Empty array - another example with mountPath key
volumeMounts: []
  # - name: data
  #   mountPath: /data

# Control: Empty array with NO commented examples (should stay as-is)
ports: []

# Control: Non-empty array (should convert normally, no stripping needed)
labels:
  - name: app
    value: myapp
  - name: version
    value: v1
